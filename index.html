                I am originally from Washington. I lived in a small town in the eastern half of the state until I was 18. Then I went to Eastern Washington University where I got my BA in Criminal Justice.

                I then moved to Seattle and worked for a time in the mental health field providing in-home support to people with developmental disabilities. However, I got tired of that kind of work an decided to go to Chile and teach English for a year.

                When I came back from Chile I went to Seattle University for my MA in Crime Analysis. After that I got a job in working for the Fargo PD. I worked there for two years before I couldn't take it anymore and I took a job at Lakewood PD. I worked for them for four years until I decided to take a job with Denver PD in June of 2019.
